# Ada Developers Academy Code Review App
An application to support and manage volunteers who provide code reviews to Ada students

## Summary
This app was created by Textio volunteers as part of the 2019 Q3 Textio Community Explorathon. Since it was created in about 2 days, it is most definitely a work in progress.

### Problem
Ada assigns students CS Fundamentals homework via GitHub PRs that are code reviewed by volunteers and instructors. The current workflow to onboard and manage volunteers is highly manual and necessitates a lot of coordination and communication. Volunteer reviewers have difficulty tracking which reviews are assigned to them and understanding how to appropriately conduct reviews, which creates obstacles to volunteer adoption and retention.

### Mission
The overarching goal of the project is to make it easier for volunteers to join the platform and review students' PRs and for instructors to manage volunteers' workflows.

## Tech Overview
The app was created with create-react-app and consists of a React frontend and a minimal Firebase Realtime Database as the backend. It mostly relies on the GitHub API for information about repos, users, etc., thereby persisting only minimal data in the database. The database stores only the info required to associated a PR with its assigned red/yellow/green grade and a direct link to the structured feedback comment on GitHub.

## Specific Goals

### Completed
- Create a new web app with a React frontend and Firebase or Rails backend
- Create design documents to visualize requested features
- Volunteers and instructors can login using GitHub credentials
- Volunteers' primary view shows the PRs they've been assigned
- Instructors' primary view shows PRs assigned to all reviewers
- PR list includes student, project link, assigned reviewer (for instructor view), review status, red/yellow/green grade for completed reviews.
- Incomplete reviews are shown at the top
- Reviewers can provide structured feedback.
    - Content of feedback.md is populated into the structured feedback text box
- Reviewers can provide a red/yellow/green grade
- Reviews are not considered complete until at least one review comment has been left on the PR and a red/yellow/green grade has been selected
- Red/yellow/green grades can be updated (from the PR list view) after initial review submission.

### Partially Completed
- Volunteers are shown guidance about how to conduct a high-quality review.
    - **Status:** View exists with placeholder text; copy needed. "Read more" link is not connected. "Contact an administrator" link is not connected.
- PR list UX
    - **Status:** Functionality is there, but did not include different coloring for completed reviews or arrow in the grade change dropdown
- Feedback form
    - We do not yet enforce that the reviewer has typed in the structured feedback textarea before they can submit.


### Not Completed
- Deploy to Heroku
- Search bar
- Filters
- Onboarding UI on first sign in of a new volunteer
- Assign PRs to reviewers

### Workflow
To support the distinction between volunteers and instructors, we use GitHub teams. This is still a mostly manual process, but many of the steps below could be automated in a future extension of the project.
1) Choose a "primary" Ada GitHub org that will hold the volunteers and instructors of record.
2) Create two teams in that org: "volunteers" and "instructors". (Names can be changed by updating `/constants.ts` and the `UserRole` type in `fetchFromGitHub.ts`.) Populate these teams with the correct instructor and volunteer members. The app will read from these teams to determine a user's access.
3) Update `/constants.ts` with the teams' IDs (can be obtained with an [authed](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication) GET request by a repo owner to `https://api.github.com/orgs/ada-code-review/teams/:team_name`).
3) Since Ada's codebase is divided into a GitHub org for each cohort, the list of cohorts must be manually updated in the code. Add the name of each organization to `GITHUB_ORGS` in `/constants.ts`.
4) When assigning an instructor or a volunteer a PR to review, add them to the PR as an **assignee** (not a reviewer, due to limitations of the reviewer API). The assignee is used to determine which reviews are assigned to a homework reviewer. The assignee must be added as a member of the org. (A future extension of the project could use the GitHub API to: Have a selector for instructors to assign reviews that 1) adds the homework reviewer to the org if they aren't a member already and 2) adds the reviewer to the PR as an assignee.)

## Known Bugs/Issues
- Ada will need to set up a new Firebase Realtime Database. Setting up the Github app and Firebase database are covered in this [video](https://youtu.be/iwA2xhbM10g). After the initial database info in the very beginning of the video, you can skip to minute 6:13 to see the Github app steps.
- We set the Firebase Realtime Database permissions to be open to all reads/writes. This should be refined for production.
- Firebase API key is checked in to GitHub (see `firebaseConfig.js`) but should probably be an environment variable.
- We should check that there isn't a memory leak in components which use the `useFetchFromFirebase` hook. If the component unmounts, we don't want `firebase.database().on('value', callback)` to continue calling the callback (see `fetchFromFirebase.ts`).
- Could be issues with rate limiting in the GitHub API. Most of the endpoints use the search API, which allows 30 authed requests per minute. If so, replacing calls to their REST API with the GraphQL API would likely remediate.
- Code structure is not as well-factored as we'd like.
- In sign in and unauthorized user views, "contact an administrator" link is not connected (see `SignInPage.tsx`, `UnauthorizedPage.tsx`).
- In volunteer PR list and sign in views, "read more" link is not connected (see `ListPage.tsx`, `SignInPage.tsx`).
- In Feedback page, the `Check GitHub` link next to the Comment Indicator is not connected (see `FeedbackPage.tsx`).
- Currently, `fetchFromFirebase` is hardcoded to only look up data from the /grades/ table. Ideally this should be refactored so that it is generic, so that it could be used to retrieve/store other data in Firebase.
- The list of PRs is pulled from a hardcoded list of orgs (see `constants.ts`). This list will need to be updated every time a new Ada cohort is added.
- To determine whether a user is an instructor or a volunteer, we need to check if they're a member of a "volunteer" or "instructor" team ID in a specific hardcoded org. Right now, the app is using test values (see `constants.ts`), but it should be updated to use an Ada org of your choice. You'll need to use the GitHub API to retrieve the IDs of the volunteer/instructor teams once they've been set up (note that this endpoint is admininistrator-only).

### Hooks and Data
We created some custom hooks to fetch data from github. In a functional component, you can get data using:
```
const {data, error, isLoading} = useFetchFromGithub<TypeScriptDataInterface>(path);
return (
    <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>
)
```

This will handle including the auth tokens. Then just use the `data`, `error`, and `isLoading` values in the JSX as usual. To post data back to github, use `fetchFromGithub` (note that this is not a hook) in a callback:

```
const onClick = () => {
    fetchFromGithub(path, {
        method: `POST`,
        body: {id: 1, value: 'New Value!'}
    })
    .then(response => { /* respond */ })
    .catch(error => { /* rescue */ })
}
return <button onClick={onClick}>Update</button>
```

This will return a promise that can be chained, calling either more API calls, updating local state, or navigating to another page.

# Boilerplate from Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
